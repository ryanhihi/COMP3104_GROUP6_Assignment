Temperatures start falling from the hot summer, the leaves turn a beautiful red and you can actually take walks outside without sweat in your buttcrack, allergies or having a cold when you come back. Plus where I live there's halloween. And me personally I enjoy a scary movie occasionally, as well as some candy and a pumpkin spice latte.
