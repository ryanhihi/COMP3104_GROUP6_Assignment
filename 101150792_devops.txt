DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops). The combinations of both 
teams and practices leads to improved collaboration, efficiency, and value in deliveries. 
The COMP3104 DevOps course is intended to give us students knowledge of effective DevOps 
techniques. We are gaining experience with some of the tools used in industry, as well as 
being shown expectations for roles of various staff and engineers working in development.

The strong focus on Version Control Systems (VCS) early on in this course has assisted
in helping students coordinate their own work and group assignments in all other courses
in the T177 or T197 program.
