DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops). The combinations of both 
teams and practices leads to improved collaboration, efficiency, and value in deliveries. 
The COMP3104 DevOps course is intended to give us students knowledge of effective DevOps 
techniques. We are gaining experience with some of the tools used in industry, as well as
