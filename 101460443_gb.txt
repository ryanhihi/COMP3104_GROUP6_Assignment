George Brown College offers 172 full-time programs (includes certificate, diploma, 
degree and graduate certificate credentials)

George Brown College’s location gives students access to top employers for field education 
and networking opportunities. It also means you’ll get to enjoy other perks of 
going to school downtown, including being close to great cafes, restaurants, shopping, 
and Toronto attractions. Our three campuses — Casa Loma, St. James and Waterfront — 
are all easily accessible by public transit and surrounded by bike lanes 
as part of Toronto’s cycling network.
