COMP 3104 DevOps is a course that teaches students about the principles and practices of DevOps, focusing on continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation of the software development process.

Core Principles of DevOps
Collaboration: Encourages communication and collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
Automation: Automates repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrastructure management to enhance efficiency and reduce errors.
Continuous Integration (CI): Merges code changes into a central repository frequently, allowing teams to detect issues early.
Continuous Delivery (CD): Ensures that software can be reliably released at any time by automating deployment processes.

How does DevOps work?
A DevOps team includes developers and IT operations working collaboratively throughout the product lifecycle, in order to increase the speed and quality of software deployment. It’s a new way of working, a cultural shift, that has significant implications for teams and the organizations they work for.

Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams merge into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle — from development and test to deployment and operations — and have a range of multidisciplinary skills.

DevOps teams use tools to automate and accelerate processes, which helps to increase reliability. A DevOps toolchain helps teams tackle important DevOps fundamentals including continuous integration, continuous delivery, automation, and collaboration.

DevOps values are sometimes applied to teams other than development. When security teams adopt a DevOps approach, security is an active and integrated part of the development process. This is called DevSecOps.
