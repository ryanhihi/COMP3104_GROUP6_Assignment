COMP 3104 DevOps is a course that teaches students about the principles and practices of DevOps, focusing on continuous integration, continuous delivery, and automation of the software development process.

Core Principles of DevOps
Collaboration: Encourages communication and collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
Automation: Automates repetitive tasks like testing, deployment, and infrastructure management to enhance efficiency and reduce errors.
Continuous Integration (CI): Merges code changes into a central repository frequently, allowing teams to detect issues early.
Continuous Delivery (CD): Ensures that software can be reliably released at any time by automating deployment processes.

How does DevOps work?
A DevOps team combines developers and IT operations to improve the speed and quality of software deployment through collaboration. This cultural shift integrates development and operations into a single team with multidisciplinary skills across the entire application lifecycle.

DevOps teams leverage automation tools to enhance reliability and address key fundamentals such as continuous integration, continuous delivery, and collaboration. Additionally, the principles of DevOps can extend to security teams, resulting in DevSecOps, where security is integrated into the development process.
