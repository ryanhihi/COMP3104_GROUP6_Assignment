The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a methodology with clearly defined 
processes for the development of software. A well structured framework with 
explicit deliverables at each stage helps reduce risks, shorten work time, lower 
costs, and overall improve quality.

Understanding the processes and benefits of the SDLC is crucial when entering 
industry for smooth integration into professional environments with experienced
team members. Being able to apply these principles and practice with the tools used
gives an advantage when first starting in any new software development job.
